# Welcome to My Tool Talk!
Hello there! Today, we will be exploring React JS, a JavaScript front-end framework developed by Facebook.

### Why React JS
I like React because it allows users to develop sleek, responsive user interfaces to an already robust back-end. There is also a smaller learning curve with React than with other frameworks such as Angular, which makes it a good candidate for front-end work.

According to [this site](https://www.sitepoint.com/react-vs-angular/), there are several questions that a team must answer when choosing a front-end framework, including:
* How mature is it and whoâ€™s behind it?
* What kind of features does it have?
* What is the ecosystem around it?
* Will I and my colleagues be able to learn this tool with ease?
* What is the developer experience like?

My goal for this presentation is to answer these questions and more while also selling React as a viable tool to use on the final project.

### About React
React was developed at Facebook and initially released in 2013. The framework also, as of this writing, has 137,000 stars on its Github repo, making it one of the most popular projects on the Github platform. Facebook's acquisition of Instagram was pivotal in the open-sourcing of the React project because the Instagram team preferred it to Facebook's other in-house Javascript frameworks _([source](https://stackshare.io/posts/the-react-story))_.

React's central features are its components, which are largely subclasses of `React.Component`. The function of a component is  to create custom HTML elements that package application data in an easily digestable and scalable format. See the example application for a look at how components are used.

Components also have the ability to remember their state. It is through this remembrance of state that we are able to see React applications become not only dynamic but truly reactive (see what I did there?!). 

### Developing with React
The first thing I noticed when I got started with React was how low the barrier of entry was. My Javascript experience was limited, but I had considerable experience with object-oriented languages and frameworks. As a result, I was prepared to hit the ground running and build simple applications which embrace React's aims to be fast and scalable.

The application present in this repository was written in a relatively short span of time; the necessary classes don't require many lines of code, and the rest is largely HTML & CSS.
